                    {"\t"}I'm pretty much a self-taught developer. I began programming since I was in College. I was
                    first introduced to the concept of programming on my first
                    major course, on this course we were taught the basics of
                    C++. I enjoyed and excelled in every course where
                    programming is involved, we were taught different
                    programming languages like Python, C++, and PHP. Python was
                    for computer vision, C++ was mainly focused on introducing
                    us to the fundamentals, and PHP was for web development with
                    a simple backend server.

                    <br></br>
                    {"\t"}My first job experience is when we had our internships
                    for College, I was tasked to make an E-Commerce Site using
                    Magento and a simple mobile application using Ionic. After
                    College, I got an internship to a startup company that
                    mainly focuses on E-Commerce applications. This is where I
                    was first introduced to Javascript frameworks in general. We
                    used React Native for building an E-Commerce application
                    that sells products from a specific brand. I was greatly
                    involved on the project and have worked on different parts
                    of the application. My tasks were mainly focus on the
                    front-end side of the application.

                    {"\t"}Upon realizing how useful and simple to use Javascript
                    Frameworks are, I took courses on Udemy regarding ReactJS,
                    React Native and NodeJS. And I&apos;m still learning
